# Notion Learning Tracker Automation 🎓

Automatically create a comprehensive learning management system in Notion based on your custom learning plan. This system includes databases, dashboards, and sample data tailored for a software engineer's journey from frontend expertise to full-stack senior engineer.

## 🆕 JSON-Based Data Management

The system now uses JSON files for all learning data, making it easier to customize and maintain your learning plan. See [JSON_DATA_GUIDE.md](JSON_DATA_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation on:
- Adding new modules, resources, and projects
- Customizing your learning path
- Validating data before import
- Maintaining backward compatibility

## 🎯 What This Creates

### 4 Core Databases
- **📚 Learning Modules**: Track 20+ modules across backend, database, system design, and AI
- **📖 Resources Library**: Manage 12+ curated books, courses, and learning materials
- **🚀 Projects Portfolio**: Plan and showcase 4 progressive hands-on projects
- **📝 Weekly Reflections**: Monitor progress, confidence levels, and study patterns

### 3 Dashboard Pages
- **📊 Learning Dashboard**: Main hub for current modules and priorities
- **📈 Progress Analytics**: Track trends, confidence levels, and study patterns
- **🎨 Project Showcase**: Professional portfolio view of your projects

## 🚀 Quick Start (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Notion API Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Create Notion Integration**:
   - Go to https://developers.notion.com/my-integrations
   - Click "New Integration"
   - Name: "Learning Tracker Automation"
   - Select your workspace
   - Copy the Integration Token (starts with `secret_`)

2. **Create Parent Page**:
   - In Notion, create a new page called "Learning Management System"
   - Click "⋯" menu → "Add connections" → Select your integration

3. **Get Page ID**:
   - Copy the page URL: `https://notion.so/Your-Page-Title-32characterID`
   - The 32-character string at the end is your page ID

### Step 2: Environment Setup (3 minutes)

1. **Clone/Download Files**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have these files in a directory:
   # - notion_database_creator.py
   # - notion_data_populator.py
   # - notion_dashboard_creator.py
   # - notion_validator.py
   # - validate_data.py (NEW)
   # - learning_plan.md
   # - requirements.txt
   # - data/ directory with JSON files (NEW)
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create Environment File**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your credentials:
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_integration_token_here
   NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=your_32_character_page_id_here
   ```

### Step 3: Run Automation (2 minutes)

Execute the scripts in order:

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Validate your JSON data
python validate_data.py

# 2. Create databases with all properties and relations
python notion_database_creator.py

# 3. Populate with learning plan data (reads from JSON files)
python notion_data_populator.py

# 4. Create dashboard pages
python notion_dashboard_creator.py

# 5. Validate everything works
python notion_validator.py
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Notion API connection failed"**
- Check your integration token in `.env`
- Verify page permissions (Add connections → your integration)
- Ensure page ID is correct (32 characters)

**"Database creation failed"**
- Confirm integration has write permissions
- Check parent page exists and is accessible
- Verify workspace permissions

**"Data population failed"**
- Ensure `database_ids.json` exists (run database creator first)
- Check that all databases were created successfully
- Verify learning_plan.md file exists

**"No data in databases"**
- Run validation script: `python notion_validator.py`
- Check for errors in data population script
- Verify database IDs are correct

### Validation Script
Run comprehensive checks:
```bash
python notion_validator.py
```
This validates:
- ✅ Environment setup
- ✅ File existence
- ✅ Notion API connection
- ✅ Database structure
- ✅ Data population
